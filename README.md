This repository is mainly used to upload my codes during the course [Algorithms Part I](https://class.coursera.org/algs4partI-007) at Coursera.

And here is the [booksite](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/)


### You should change the default path of stdlib.jar and algs4.jar to run these code in your own computer.
